Hey, I am Jacob. I am a 12th grader with a passion for tech, aswell and mountain biking and skiing. I have done some computer science classes such as Java Programming and AP Computer Science Principles. Within those classes, I have dome some projects here and there.

My main interest right now is cybersecurity. I would love to get into the field, and am currently beginning self-learning/studying for a certificate, and to learn more about the topic.
